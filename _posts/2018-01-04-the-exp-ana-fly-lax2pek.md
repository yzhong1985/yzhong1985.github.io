### Reward points from credit card
My baby girl has turned to her 9 months, we figured that it is the time to bring her back to China to visit the 'new' grand parents. As the Chinese new year is around the corner, we need to start making a plan for the trip. In 2017, I did collect a number of points via different credit cards (mostly via new customer spending reward from Amex and Chase). now it's the time for them to be used. 

After a study among the reward points exchange policies from Amex & Chase; also the points to reward tickets at different airlines, I found the ANA will be probably my best way to go. The round trip busniess class can be redeemed at 95,000 pts (USA to Asia), this is a really good deal if we compare with some other airlines (one way business can cost you about 100K pts between the same region). the ANA points can be exchanged by Amex MR points at a 1：1 ratio. in fact, this has been considered as maybe the best way to use the MR pts. (I recently applied another Amex EPD :-) keep spending..)

### The stopover choices
Once we decided ANA, one of the benifits it has is the one free stopover it allows. This means, we can fly to a city in between and travel for a few days before the final destination (Beijing in our case). We think about stopping at Japan or Taiwan for 3-4 days, but final give up due to different reasons. (For Japan, the US to Japan busniess class tickets availability is low, and we need to be placed on waitlist.., for Taiwan, as my wife is a Chinese citizen, she needs to get a certain permit to enter. Even it's not too hard to apply, but we just simply don't want any hassle)

Finally, we choosed another country - South Korea

There are a few reasons make South Korea a very desirable choice:
* ANA points can be used to redeem the flight from Asiana airlines, which usually has very good availability on business
* My wife can enter without visa for 30 days (if you are just doing a stopover)
* We never been there before, always want to try its food and do some shopping
So, the final route has been decided! LAX - ICN - PEK (all flying Asiana) and then PEK - LAX (direct flight by Air China) all business

## The actual points transfer time      
The total ANA pts needed is 190,000 (95,000 * 2); I almost started the points exchange process right away since I know it could take time. 150,000 was transfered from my Amex MR pts, and the rest 40,000, I exchanged from my SPG points (can also excahnge for ANA points at 1:1). The MR pts was transfered very quick, it gets executed the next day; but the SPG takes a FULL 20 DAYs to be appeared in my ANA account, so advice here: if you want to use SPG for ANA, get started as early as possible. Luckily, I planned it early enough, so I was still able to reedem my ticket in time. (I quickly booked all the tickets the same day I received the SPG pts) the total points spent breakdown as below:
* 150,000 Amex MR points: 100,000 from my Amex Platinum; 50,000 from the Amex PRG card; both were rewarded via opening new card spending bonus
* 40,000 SPG points: 35,000 from the SPG opening new card spending bonus, 5k from my regular spending bonus
* $400+ tax and fuel surcharge - not cheap, almost a economy round trip ticket

At this point, I thought things are all settled; at least for the airline tickets, and we can move on to have fun on making the 3 days travel plan in Seoul, such as hotel booking and what attractions we should go check out.. but in fact, one thing was overlooked, the ticket for my baby girl. 

### Baby ticket
It is not the very first time we take our baby to an airplane. A few month ago, we travelled to New York with her, which was a 6-hours long flight. She was doing really well, kept sleeping for most of the time, did not make too much trouble for us, so I am not too worry about her on the airplane. the thing is, for domastic flight, the baby under two is usually free if they can stay on one of the parents lap. Unfortunately, this is not the same for international flights. In short, there will be a charge even the baby doesn't occupy a seat, the amount varies among different airline. I was a little scared when I see some airlines charge 10% of the full amount of the price for the ticket, and they dont take mileage points, a guy on internet saying they used points to redeem a business seat and was charged $2,000 for their baby as their full price for the seat was $20,000 .. :-(. 

I quickly contact Asiana and Air China to find out. As a result, Asiana can take points for baby, so it's 10% of the points that need to redeem for an adult tickets, which is 6,500 pts, this is awesome! but Air China will only take 10% of the ticket price, and it turned out to be $700... in the end, I just paid it, as there is nothing else I can really do at that point.

### Summary
There are a few takeaways in the process:
1. As long as the ANA's 95,000 pts round trips redeem exsits, the Amex MR points is the preferred option for spending, the free stopover is very useful, I tested a few other destinations (Hawaii, Saipan, Guam, HongKong, Macow, Taiwan, Japan and Korea) and they are ALL POSSIBLE to be the stopover!
2. For SPG points exchange, start at least 2 months before, it took me 20 days but I've seem other people take even longer
3. Baby tickets (under 2) friendly airlines include Korean Airline, Asiana, Air Canada, British Airways, and Emirates. They can take mileage points for this (which should be always cheaper); most of the other airlines take 10% of the tickets price; one airline need to be awared - the Cathay Pacific takes 25% of the ticket price for baby!
4. You can contact either ANA or the actual excuted airlines to purchase the baby tickets, each one will have their own policy;  you can always compare and go with the best option.
