One of the reason for this build is my old PC (2700X & MSI Tomahawk B350) keep crushing in Windows 10 and has been behaving weird even after 2-3 attampts of reinstalling OS. I started to doubt that it's the hardware issue. In fact, it has been stable for almost 2 years; the only thing is I can't install any new Windows updates; it might have something to do with my bootloader, since I have Ubuntu setup on one of my partition and can be booted into when starting computer; it's been always giving me some small issues during the past. so a few days ago, I deceided to just do a clean install of the latest version of Windows 10. I did a BIOS update for the motherboard, then installed the system; that's when all the problems began to surface.

### The crushing problem
After the OS installation, it was running great for a few days. then it began to crush or freeze the screen occasionally. In BIOS, I left everything as default all the time, so it shouldn't have the problem such like the voltage is not enough when the core frequency was set too high (overclocked). One time I thought it was a problem with the RAM, I did run the Memery test for 1-2 hours but didn't detect any issues. Then I thought it could be a problem with one of the hard drive, but later on I found even I don't use that hard drive at all, the crush still happens. As it really bothered me a lot, I started to think about upgrading my CPU and motherboard; I know the B350 Tomahawk (4+2 VRM) could be a potential bottleneck for the power delivery, that's why it didn't receive the same amount of praise as its successors, the Tomahawk X570 and B550.
