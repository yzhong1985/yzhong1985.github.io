The World Cup 2018 just ended, France team lift the trophy after 20 years; their great vitory in the final really brings me back to the night of 1998 summer, when I was a middle school student. The 1998 World Cup is actually the first time I started to follow the international football. I still remember the prediction I made that France will win the title the first time after I watched a group stage game (France won 3-0 ,I can't even remember the team they played against);  in the final, the defending chaimpion - Brazil was definitely the favorable side, but France won the match perfectly without even giving Brazil any chance. Their excellent defence was impressive (Blanc, Desailly, and Thuram) and it started from the midfielders (Vieira and Deschamps); Other than that, Zidane was at his prime, and the two young forwarders - Henry and Trezeguet were raising. that France team was one of the dream teams which I consider dominating the world football for many years until the 2002 World Cup. I think they can actually beat the Spain team which domiinated the world later years.. 

But I want to talk about the Croatia; they are my favorite team in this World Cup. Before the final, I really like to see they win the title; their tough mindset and their attacking style were fun to watch, and luck is finally on their side for a few times(penalty shootout). In the final, to be honest, France clearly overpowered them; and Croatia was actually kinda lucky to make the 2nd goal to have the 2-4 as final score; Anyway, making to the final was already the greatest achievement in their history and they were suppose to be satisfied already. In fact, the first time when Croatia football team shocked the world was the same World Cup, 20 years ago in 1998 at France. That's kinda interesting. I remeber they beat Germany 3-0 and made to the semi final, and lost to France (by the two shocking goals from Thuram) and finally got the 3rd place. Davor Suker won the Golden Boot for that World Cup; From there, the Croatia football was going downward. I watched them loss to Brazil and also loss to Mexio in 2014; I watched them loss to Portugal in the overtime in 2016 Euro Cup; and this time, they finally have their chance to revange to the team which rejected them from entering final 20 years ago, but they fail short again. I hope they will finally beat France one day in future.. but realality is that, this is actually their golden chance, most of the team are at their best ages: Mandžukić(32)，Modrić(32)，Rakitić(30)，Perišić(29). In next a few years, these guys will likely start to descend, and won't be this good anymore. 

Anyway, this is definitely a geat memory for the people of Croatia, the country which only has 4 million population. Amazing achievement!
